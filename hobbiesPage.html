               She loves animals and currently has two cats. Her love of animals has led her to pursue a career with animals.She is currently working as a vet assistant and really enjoys her position. Her dream is to someday work with animals to help people with disabilities or study animal behavior to help pet owners. Although the professional life is very appealing to her, she ultimately would love to find a husband and start a family. In her past time, she enjoys coloring, hiking, movies, piano, and spending time with family and friends. She loves the state of Washington, specifically the Puget sound area, due to its natural green landscape. The mountains, rivers, lakes, ocean, and hilly terrain are all things she loves about Washington. Another thing she loves about the Puget sound area is that it has four seasons. Her favorite parts of the year are the transition periods between seasons.
